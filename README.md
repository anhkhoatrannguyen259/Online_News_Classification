# Online News Classification
We build a new dataset UIT-ViON (Vietnamese Online Newspaper) collected from well-known online newspapers in Vietnamese. We collect, process, and create the dataset with 260.000 samples, then experiment and evaluate it using different types of machine learning (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes), deep learning method (TextCNN), and transfer learning (PhoBERT).
